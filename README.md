## Fizzbuzz

Pair programming for Makers Pre-Course Week 4

- Used RSpec testing - with guidance [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/pre_course/blob/master/pills/rspec.md)
- Pair programmed on kata with Jack: <https://github.com/artfulgarfunk>
- You can run a RSpec file using the command: `$ rspec spec/test_spec.rb`
- Error messages remain the same between different `require` syntax in RSpec file
- Writing as an instance method: replace all references to the argument with `self` and include inside the `::Fixnum` class **and** remove the reference to the argument in the method definition - so `def fizzbuzz(number)` changes to `def fizzbuzz`
