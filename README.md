Pair programming for Makers Pre-Course Week 4

- Used RSpec testing - with guidance [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/pre_course/blob/master/pills/rspec.md)
- You can run a RSpec file using the command: `$ rspec spec/test_spec.rb`
- Error messages remain the same between different `require` syntax in RSpec file
